                The project is based on the real life simulation of a round-about.
                Here our observations about traffic signalling, traffic movement, jam causing factors and many more play a vital role.
                We make use of <b>Weakest Chain problem</b> to decide the flow of the jam. Since the average speed of every vehicle is
                different so there will be different speed for the movement of every lane.
                <br>
                The congestion for each road is calculated on the basis of the space consumed by the vehicles
                divided by the total space of the road. Throughput is calculated by the number of vehicles previously occupying the
                road minus the number of vehicles remaining.
                <br>
                For orange light at the night, First Come First Serve is also implemented. And also if vehicles entered are more
                than the road can accomodate then they enter wait array. This array is cleared as soon as the vehicles start moving
                when the Green Signal is given to the road.
                <br>
                Signalling is done in clockwise direction, and for anti-clockwise direction the congestion being cleared was similar.
                Signal Time is also scalled because there maybe some variations when the traffic is being cleared.
                So in the end Traffic Simulation is done.
