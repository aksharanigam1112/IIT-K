        <h1>Facts & Observations</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                After visting many round-abouts in Kanpur itself, we collected the facts that :-
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> For a 2 lane road people tend to form mostly 3 psuedo-lanes.</li>
                    <li> The leftmost lane is always in motion.</li>
                    <li> While the other two lanes are under the control of Traffic Siganl.</li>
                    <li> The Trucks, Tankers and Trollers mostly are found during night hours (10pm to 6am)</li>
                    <li> Also, during 11pm to 4am Orange light glows, which symbolises First come First Serve Traffic Movement</li>
                    <li> Further we observed that Trollers occupied the maximum road space, followed by Tankers, Trucks & Buses, 
                            Cars, E-rickshaws & Tempos and lastly Bikes, Scooties and Cycles.</li>
                    <li> Correspondingly, Bikes & Scooties move at the fastest pickup speed followed by Cars, Tempos,
                            E-rickshaw, Bus, unloaded Tanker then comes unloaded Troller, Truck and lastly comes
                            loaded Troller, Loaded Tanker and Cycle.</li>
                    <li> So with this and along with some approximations we concluded that the size of each vehicle can be measured
                            in units where each unit is equal to 2.5 meters</li>
                    <li> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Trucks & Buses = 5u</li>
                            <li>Loaded & Unloaded Tankers = 6u</li>
                            <li>Loaded & Unloaded Trollers = 7u</li>
                            <li>Cars, Tempos & E-rickshaw = 2u</li>
                            <li>Bikes, Scooties & Cycles = 1u</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li> Similarly the road length is also expressed in units(u) and space consumed.</li>
                </ol>
