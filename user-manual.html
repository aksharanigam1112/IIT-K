            <ol>
                <li> Start by first entering your Choice, either enter the values for each Road yourself keeping in mind the limits or let 
                     the default values be filled.</li>
                <li> For user input, enter the values in text field and correspondingly space is calculated. </li>
                <li> These values have to be entered for each road of the Round-about</li>
                <li> While for Default input, only time has to be entered for which roads have to be filled with the data.</li>
                <li> The Facts & Observations provide you the insights of the project.</li>
                <li> The Records tell you the previous data for the roads and their corresponding Congestion.</li>
                <li> While, the Report clearly explains the project idea and it background working.</li>
                <li> Everything in the project is worked on units(u), where each unit is equal to 2.5 meters.</li>
                <li> The space for the roads and vehicles is also calculated in terms of units(u).</li>
                <li> After the values are entered, the output for each road is displayed which explains the throughput for the roads.</li>
                <li> Warnings are also given when the values entered exceed the maximum limit.</li>
